SANDSMILE is a website designed to inspire and encourage users to become dedicated collectors of debris that invades ocean beaches. The site allows users to track their individual and collective impact on collected trash across various coastal geographies. By transforming the beach into places where sand smiles, users not only contribute to a cleaner environment but also gain financial benefits. Sandsmile acts to foster a community of socially responsible citizens and companies, turning beach cleanup into a rewarding and impactful endeavor.

BE SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE CITIZEN
After registering or logging in, you gain access to your personal page, where you can track your activity effectively:

Time Tracking: Use a timer to record the duration of your activity. Start and stop the timer to accurately log the time spent on cleaning;

Location Selection: Choose the specific beach where you're conducting the cleanup. This helps in organising and overviewing efforts;

Amount Collected: Record the quantity of waste collected in liters. This data will assess your impact.


For dedicated participants who meet specific criteria, we offer an enhanced status called 'Cleaners Plus - Smilers':

Eligibility: Cleaners who have been registered for over six months, with a minimum collection of 1000 liters and participation in at least one platform-organized event, qualify for 'Cleaners Plus - Smilers' status; Benefits: Upon achieving 'Smiler' status, you receive a 5% on donations. This incentive recognizes your commitment and encourages continued engagement in our cleanup initiatives.

Your donation, as a socially responsible company and/or individual, will be used to hold awareness-raising sessions, organize community clean-up events on Portugal's beaches, and reward our smiling cleaners who show the greatest dedication to the activity.
